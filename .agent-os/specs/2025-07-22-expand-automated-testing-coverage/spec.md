# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: expand-automated-testing-coverage
> Created: 2025-07-22
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Expand automated testing coverage to include comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) tests for all critical user flows, components, and API endpoints. This will ensure reliability, catch regressions early, and support continuous delivery.

## User Stories

### Reliable User Experience
As a product owner, I want all major features and flows to be covered by automated tests, so that I can confidently deploy changes without breaking existing functionality.

- When a developer pushes code, the test suite runs and reports any failures before merge.

### Developer Confidence
As a developer, I want to quickly know if my changes break anything, so that I can fix issues before they reach production.

- When I run `npm test` or push a PR, I get immediate feedback on test results.

## Spec Scope

1. **Unit Testing** - Write/expand tests for all major React components, hooks, and utilities.
2. **Integration Testing** - Cover key user flows (forms, navigation, API calls) with integration tests.
3. **E2E Testing** - Implement E2E tests for critical journeys using Playwright or Cypress.
4. **CI Integration** - Ensure all tests run on every PR and display status in the repo.
5. **Documentation** - Document test strategy and how to run tests.

## Out of Scope

- Manual QA processes
- Performance/load testing
- Non-critical legacy code not in active use

## Expected Deliverable

1. All major components, hooks, and flows have automated test coverage.
2. CI runs all tests on every PR and blocks merges on failure.
3. Documentation for running and maintaining tests is available.
